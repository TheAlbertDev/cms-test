  A novel self-powered point-of-care low-power electronics approach for galvanic
  cell-based sample concentration measurement is presented. The electronic
  system harvests and senses at the same time from the single cell. The system
  implements a solution that is suitable in those scenarios where extreme low
  power is generated from the fuel cell. The proposed approach implements a
  capacitive-based method to perform a non-linear sweep voltammetry to the cell,
  but without the need to implement a potentiostat amplifier for that purpose.
  It provides a digital-user readable result without the need for external
  non-self-powered devices or instruments compared with other solutions. The
  system conception was validated for a particular case. The scenario consisted
  of the measurement of a NaCl solution as the electrolyte, which was related to
  the conductivity of the sample. The electronic reader continuously measured
  the current with a transfer function gain of 1.012 V mA<sup>−1</sup>. The
  overall system exhibited a maximum coefficient of variation of 6.1%, which was
  an improvement compared with the state-of-the-art. The proof of concept of
  this electronics system was validated with a maximum power consumption of 5.8
  μW using commercial-off-the-self parts.
