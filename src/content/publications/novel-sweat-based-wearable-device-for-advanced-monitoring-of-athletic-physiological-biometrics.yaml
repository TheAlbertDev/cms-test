  Blood testing has traditionally been the gold standard for the physiological
  analysis and monitoring of professional athletes. In recent years, blood
  testing has moved out of the laboratory thanks to portable handheld devices,
  such as lactate meters. However, despite its usefulness and widespread use,
  blood testing has several drawbacks and limitations, such as the need for the
  athlete to stop exercising for blood extraction and the inability to have data
  continuously collected. In this scenario, sweat has become an alternative to
  blood testing because of its rich content of electrolytes and metabolites, as
  well as small quantities of sugars, proteins, and ions. Nevertheless, there
  are few devices capable of analyzing this biofluid and providing useful
  information to users. In this paper, an electronic system designed for the
  autonomous analysis of sweat electrolytes and metabolites along with heart
  rate dynamics is presented. This system is part of a novel wearable device
  tailored for athletes that offers to the user a real-time assessment of their
  physiological status and performance.
